# How Private Client Investors can Participate in Europe’s Alternatives to Russian Gas Supply

> **View the full report [here](pages-assets/citi/cgw-guidera-22.pdf).**

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 precipitated an unprecedented energy crisis in Europe. At the time of writing, year-on-year Russian deliveries have fallen by two thirds, with the threat of further supply cuts heading into winter. Europe must now replace (or eliminate demand for) 40% of its natural gas supply. To address the challenge, short-term responses have been activated and policy frameworks put in place, all of which indicate that the private sector is an important part of the solution.

**The question posed by client Citi Global Wealth was how their clientele of wealthy individuals and family offices might support Europe's pivot away from Russian gas**. 

The Capstone workshop's answer is to identify possible investment targets among the publicly listed companies leading Europe's transition. The report develops a framework to assist Citi Global Wealth’s clients to sort the universe of key players.

Based on a review of the solutions expected to contribute most to gas supply replacement and demand reduction, the report identifies four areas most likely to contain investable players – LNG imports (Part 2), LNG exports (Part 3), wind and solar (Part 4) and space heating (Part 5). Other solutions are considered in Part 6. The report adopts a consistent analytic procedure assessing the key players on two measures – the scope of each company's operational focus on Europe, and its likelihood of being a suitable investment target for Citi’s clients (based on opportunities and risks, and filters on the appropriate investment universe). A likelihood-scope mapping is presented as a matrix at the end of each part.

***The interactive chart below summarizes the report's main findings. For each solution set, we forecast a contribution to gas replacement/reduction by volume, and identify likely target investments for Citi's clients (mouse-over to display tooltip).***
