# Flood classification using satellite images

*Completed as part of QMSS5055 GR - Practicum in Large-Scale Data Analysis and Processing with Professor Charlie Riemann. The client was KPMG Digital Lighthouse (New York Office).*

This project that aims to use deep learning image classification models to predict flood events and mitigate losses. The final CNN model achieved an accuracy of 81.06%. The data for the project was collected from satellite images provided by [Planet](https://www.planet.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAiJSeBhCCARIsAHnAzT-6cawyxaMIl2gj_wPZsDY--dcOFRJxt2UaBknxTzl-xx4YBO5i-_gaAm-lEALw_wcB) and flood event records from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

The data were preprocessed to create a balanced structure. The model was improved through standard hyperparameter tuning, and techniques such as pseudo labelling and confounder control. The project's final outcome is a business application that measures the economic impact of flooding, with potential application to historically low-flood regions that may experience rapid increases in flooding activity in future years as a result of climate change related threats.
